# BD4QoLPredict Dashboard

This branch contains the BD4QoLPredict dashboard, a user friendly tool to interact with the BD4QoLPredict API and retrieve predictions. 

## Server Wakening time

When using the BD4Predict API for the first time, or after a period of inactivity, you may experience a slight delay in receiving predictions. This is because the API is hosted on an Azure server that enters a sleep state when not in use for an extended period. The initial request triggers the server to wake up, which can take a little time. Subsequent requests should be processed more quickly once the server is fully active.

This behavior is important for several reasons, particularly in the context of resource management, energy consumption, and environmental impact. By allowing the server to enter a sleep state during periods of inactivity, the system conserves computational resources and reduces energy usage. This not only helps in lowering operational costs but also minimizes the carbon footprint associated with running cloud-based services. Efficient resource management is crucial in promoting sustainable technology practices, as it contributes to reducing the overall environmental impact of data centers, which are significant consumers of energy. By optimizing server usage, the BD4Predict API aligns with broader efforts to create more environmentally friendly and sustainable digital infrastructures.

## Imputation and uncertainty

The accuracy and reliability of predictions generated by the BD4Predict API can be affected when a significant number of quality of life variables are missing and require imputation. Imputation is a statistical technique used to estimate missing data, but it introduces a degree of uncertainty into the predictions. When many variables are imputed, the model's ability to accurately reflect the true conditions and outcomes diminishes, leading to less precise predictions. Therefore, for the most reliable results, it is important to provide as complete and accurate data as possible, minimizing the need for imputation and enhancing the model's predictive power. We use KNN imputer which does not take into account imputation uncertainty as a single imputation method.
