  Before using the dashboard please read the information bellow.
  
    <h2> Waiting time on the first prediction </h2>
    <p>
        When using the BD4Predict API for the first time, or after a period of inactivity, you may experience a slight delay in receiving predictions. This is because the API is hosted on an Azure server that enters a sleep state when not in use for an extended period. The initial request triggers the server to wake up, which can take a little time. Subsequent requests should be processed more quickly once the server is fully active.
    </p>

    <p>
        This behavior is important for several reasons, particularly in the context of resource management, energy consumption, and environmental impact. By allowing the server to enter a sleep state during periods of inactivity, the system conserves computational resources and reduces energy usage. This not only helps in lowering operational costs but also minimizes the carbon footprint associated with running cloud-based services. Efficient resource management is crucial in promoting sustainable technology practices, as it contributes to reducing the overall environmental impact of data centers, which are significant consumers of energy. By optimizing server usage, the BD4Predict API aligns with broader efforts to create more environmentally friendly and sustainable digital infrastructures.
    </p>
<h2> Missing data and imputation uncertainty</h2>
    <p>
        The accuracy and reliability of predictions generated by the BD4Predict API can be affected when a significant number of quality of life variables are missing and require imputation. Imputation is a statistical technique used to estimate missing data, but it introduces a degree of uncertainty into the predictions. When many variables are imputed, the model's ability to accurately reflect the true conditions and outcomes diminishes, leading to less precise predictions. Therefore, for the most reliable results, it is important to provide as complete and accurate data as possible, minimizing the need for imputation and enhancing the model's predictive power.

<h2>About the BD4QoL project</h2>
    <p>
        The BD4QoL (Big Data for Quality of Life) project is an innovative initiative aimed at enhancing the quality of life for cancer patients through the use of big data and advanced analytics. By integrating data from various sources, including clinical records, patient-reported outcomes, and lifestyle information, the project seeks to develop personalized care strategies that address the unique needs of each patient. The goal is to improve long-term health outcomes and well-being by providing healthcare professionals with actionable insights and tools to tailor interventions more effectively. Through collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and technology experts, BD4QoL aims to transform cancer care and support systems, ultimately leading to better patient experiences and outcomes.
